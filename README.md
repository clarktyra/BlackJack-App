# UCSD Mob Programing Black Jack App

## Activity: 
Mob program a basic BlackJack website from scratch utilizing any technologies that we have used in the class.

## Process: 
Using only 1 computer and the projector, each person attending the session takes a turn being the Driver, the person who types the code, while the rest of the group are the Navigators, the ones thinking, describing, discussing, and steering what we are designing/developing. The Driver can still participate in the discussion but their main job should be on typing the code the Navigators agree on. 

## Rotation: 
New Driver every 8 min. Every person gets to be the Driver before someone can be the Driver again. 

## TimeLine: 
Morning office hours. Finish before final projects. 

## Intention: 
Step outside your comfort zone. Collaboration and communication. Review. See what you can accomplish as a group. Code and think about coding in a different way. Practice a modern development technique. Have fun. 

## Participation: 
TA will monitor Driver rotation, as well as participate as a Driver and Navigator. However, this is the Mob’s website. Everyone that participates has an equal say in it’s direction.
